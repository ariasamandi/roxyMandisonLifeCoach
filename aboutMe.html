          Hi my name is Roxy and I’m a dedicated certified life coach (CLC) specializing in empowering women to live purposeful, meaningful lives and relationship coaching.
          I have been a mental health therapist for over 2 years and have a Master’s in Social Work. I’ve always cared about helping others and creating a better world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I grew up in Los Angeles by the beach and now live with my husband in Cupertino, CA. I enjoy going to the beach, hiking, and traveling on my free time. 
          In my early 20’s I volunteered in a country called Kosovo where I facilitated a community builiding program on the grassroots level. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My coaching approach is centered on creating a <span>safe, non-judgmental</span> space where you can explore your highest aspirations, identify obstacles, and develop strategies to <span>overcome</span> them. 
          Together, we will work on transforming your <span>challenges into opportunities for growth</span> and creating a life that truly resonates with <span> who you are.</span> 
        </p>
